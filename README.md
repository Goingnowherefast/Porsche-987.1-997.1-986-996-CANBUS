# Porsche-987.1-997.1-986-996-CANBUS
Here you will find an updated repository of the combined .DBC's for many Porsches including the 997.1, 987.1, 986, and 996 DBW cars. 
Initial .DBC's for the 987.1 & 997.1 were created from the community and modified/fixed/added by myself using my own reverse engineering and translation from a uncovered Porsche .DBC. Please use VECTOR DB++ (to see multiplexing and value tables) which can be downloaded from the VECTOR download base here: https://www.vector.com/int/en/support-downloads/download-center/#tab=1&pageSize=15&sort=date&order=desc

The 997 R8 .DBC is to date the most complete .DBC available for this chassis that I can find online by a longshot. 997.1 R8 .DBC is valid for the 987 as long as you use the correct engine multiplexor code. 

Please contact me if you find any issues with any of the files or would like to add anything!
